In line with urban transport development, the Buddy City Municipal Subway Transit Corporation by Buddy City Transport Bureau were established. In the same month, they took over the operation of the Airport Express from Buddy City Municipal Subway Transit Corporation by Buddy City Transport Bureau.\n\nIn April 2018, the planning for the municipal subway construction began. The first phase was completed in May of the same year, and the entire system officially opened on May 3rd.\n\nOn July 3, 2022, the Central Line's second phase from Tanimachi 4-chome to Nanba extended. The Futa Keihan Line's first phase from Kiyo Mizu to Kyoto and from Meguro Gawa to Desert Tokyo extended. As a result, the Kiyo Mizu Sha Tin Line was discontinued and replaced by the Futa Keihan Line. The first phase of the Kiyo Gen Line was completed, leading to the discontinuation of the Hangen Line, which was renamed the Kiyo Gen Line.\n\nOn July 17, 2022, the Central Line and the Futa Keihan Line connected directly at Tanimachi 4-chome. The second phase of the Kiyo Gen Line from Kiyo Mizu to the Osaka Business Park extended. The Kiyo Gen Line now covers the Osaka area, and to avoid confusion with the original route, it was renamed the Hangen Ryokuchi Line.\n\nOn August 7, 2022, the third phase of the Futa Keihan Line to Higashi Umeda Station was completed. The new route Mido Suji Line's first phase opened.\n\nThe network covers the entire Buddy City and provides residents and tourists with a fast commuting transportation system.",
